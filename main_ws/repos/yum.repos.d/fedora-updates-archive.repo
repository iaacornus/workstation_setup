# This is a repo that contains all the old update packages from the
# Fedora updates yum repository (i.e. the packages that have made it
# to "stable"). This repo is needed for OSTree based systems where users
# may be trying to layer packages on top of a base layer that doesn't
# have the latest stable content. Since base layer content is locked
# the package layering operation will fail unless there are older versions
# of packages available.
#
# This repo is given a high cost in order to prefer the normal Fedora
# yum repositories, which means only packages that can't be found
# elsewhere will be downloaded from here.
